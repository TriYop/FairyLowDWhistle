# Fairy Low D Whistle

I sampled my Susato Kildare Low D Whistle. 
Samples are looped to increase notes length and there is 2 to 4 round-robin samples on every sampled note. to increase realism. 

Here is the setup I used to sample it:
| | |
|---|---|
| **Instrument** | Susato Kildare Low D Whistle |
| **Microphone** | Apex 435 |
| **Preamp** | Behringer Ultraagain pro mic2200 |
| **Audio Interface** | Mackie Onyx Producer | 
| **Recording Software** | Ardour 7 (Linux) |
| **Tested sampler** | SFizz |

I made 4 different fonts
- FairyLowDWhistle-body.sfz has more of the body of the sound
- FairyLowDWhistle-blow.sfz has more air
- FairyLowDWhistle-combined.sfz combines both of the previous
- FairyLowDWhistle-performance.sfz aims to provide control of air through CC2 (breath)

CC1 allows in both to control the volume.
